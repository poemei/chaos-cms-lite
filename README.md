# chaos-cms-lite
A JSON driven lite version of the Chaos CMS

# Why JSON?
Because Databases can and will fail from time to time, and this is portable

# Why another Content Management System?
Because most of them out there are rediculously heavy resource usage with large footprints, the ChaosCMS is small, lightweight, portable and esy to use.

# Why Chaos?
Because thats how my life had been since birth, and it fits, cause this has been a very chaotic project.

# Care to help?
We need more devs to take a peek and contribute.
